### How does Bifrost work?
Bifrost provides an intermediate abstraction layer between staking and the application layer, so that the staking behavior and the application layer behavior originally built on the underlying architecture of the public chain change from a parallel and mutually exclusive relationship to a vertically compatible relationship, thereby solving staking and DeFi, The mutual exclusion of cross-chain activities. Through the Bifrost parachain, users can deposit Tokens for staking into vTokens at any time, and then Bifrost's cross-chain interaction module uses the collected tokens to perform staking operations on the original chain. Each PoS Token will correspond to a different vToken, such as bridged Polkadot token DOT, corresponding to vDOT, and Ethereum token ETH to vETH. Simply put, by providing the liquidity of vToken, it is possible to take into account the liquidity of the original chain assets and the security of the original chain system. Users who hold vTokens can continuously obtain staking benefits, and use vTokens to participate in DeFi and cross-chain activities, and no longer conflict with staking benefits.

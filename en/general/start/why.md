### Why Bifrost?  

The Bifrost project was created to solve staking problems. Its mission and vision is to provide liquidity for as many staking assets on the chain as possible (Staking, Collateral, PLO, cross-chain locking...) and become more Connectors between chains. The project first uses the staking scenario as an entry point to provide liquidity by issuing asset derivatives. After continuous iterative research and development, it will adapt to all scenarios involving pledged assets on the chain in the future. The Bifrost project has obtained the Web3 Foundation Grant and is a member of the Substrate Builders Program. It is one of the 15 core members of the Web3 Bootcamp incubator. It has obtained the Web3 Foundation and Wanxiang Blockchain Laboratory in technology, product, capital, legal affairs, and ecological Comprehensive support in cooperation and other fields.
